That curiosity has now grown into a commitment to fully transition into the tech space. Currently, I'm holding on to the excitement of diving into Software Development, with particular interest in how ideas evolve from scratch and grow into real working products that solve problems and create value. Beyond the love for creativity and problem-solving, I was also drawn to the potential of earning a flexible global income remotely by doing actual meaningful work.</p>
